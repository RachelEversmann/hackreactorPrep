<!-- Exercise: In a script tag, create variables name, age, gender, and is_member, thirsty and drink_of_choice and assign them appropriate values or no values at all. Then compose a paragraph in a div#greeting according to the following rules:

If they are not a member or if they are under the age of 21, address them as sir or ma'am as appropriate and apologetically deny them access to the club.
Otherwise, greet them as Mr. or Mrs. (as appropriate by gender) and their name, and welcome them. If they are thirsty, prompt them as to what drink they would like.
If their favorite drink is anything but "Coors Light", tell them "yes" (name) "one" (drink_name) "coming right up!". If they ask for a Coors, kick them out. -->
